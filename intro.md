Who am I and what am I doing here?
----------------------

I'm starting up a new blog as I found my previous blog [Experienced Django] to
be too restrictive.  While I found that working through a Django project or two
fun and interesting, I found myself wanting to write about topics that weren't
Django, or even Python, related.

This blog will be my vehicle for that.

I'm a well-seasoned developer (read: OLD) who has spent many years developing in
c-like languages: C, C++, Java, Lua, Python, Perl, etc. Much of my experience is
in embedded systems, most recently doing embedded linux products.

I'm currently working on a large infrastructure monitoring application, doing
low-level networking and guaranteed delivery layers.

I plan on writing about Python, C/C++, debugging, office politics, and whatever
is striking my fancy at the time.  Hopefully this will give me enough fodder
that I'll be able to maintain a weekly delivery schedule.

It'll be fun to see where this leads!
