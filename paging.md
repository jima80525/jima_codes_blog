Paginating output from a command line programs seems like it should be easy, but
before you go and write it yourself (and discover all the fun of terminal types),
I recommend the [Click](http://click.pocoo.org/5/) package.  Click is a handy
little tool for creating command line applications.  While it looks like much
of the package is devoted to command line args and subcommands, it also has a
nice paging utility for relatively small amounts of text.

How To
------
I was really impressed with how simple Click made paginating the display of a
block of text.  If you discount some minor refactoring I had to do to make a
function work with the click.command decorator, there were really only three
changes needed:

1. add `import click`

2. add `@click.command()` decorator to my function

3. change the output section from a for loop printing each line to calling
`click.echo_via_pager('\n'.join(lines))`


Pros
----
Click is well put together, well documented, installed with pip, and worked
easily!  I was definitely happy with it for my original task, which was
paginating a few hundred lines of text.

Cons
----
I ran another test with a second script, this time using a generator to process
tens of thousands of lines of text.  The paginator in Click was definitely not
designed for this use case and I couldn't make it work.

Conclusion
----------
I was quite happy with how easy Click made the simple task simple.  Looking at
the documentation, it seems that there are a number of other features which
will be handy for some of my bigger projects.  I'll definitely be pulling it in
for some future projects and refactoring.  I hope to have a comparison of
click and argparse in a future post.
