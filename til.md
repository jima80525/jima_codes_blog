# TIL - Keeping track of small ideas

If you're like most developers, you have a wide range of "little things" that
you do just infrequently enough that you never remember exactly how to do them.
"How do I open the filename under my cursor in Vim?", "How do I commit only part
of a file in Git?", "How do I get sed to replace xxx with yyy in a series of
files?", etc.  The sort of things that you know are possible, but just don't use
often enough to commit to memory.

There are many techniques for remembering these, ranging from googling it every
time you need it to writing it down in a lab notebook.  I recently
came across an idea that's really growing on me, called TIL for "today I learned...".

The examples I've seen are kept in a github repo with a nice markdown index as
the README.md file.  Each of the little tidbits of information are kept in their
own markdown file in a directory indicating a category.  For example, you might
have a `git` directory with a `partial_commit.md` file.

The example I first saw, [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til),
was organized this way.  He also was very consistent in placing a good title at
the top of each topic file.  This consistency makes it very easy to automate
the creation of the README file, so I've added that to my version (and created
a pull request for the original author).

You can see the creation script [here](https://github.com/jima80525/til/blob/master/createReadme.py).
